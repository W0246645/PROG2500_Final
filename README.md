PROG 2500 WINDOWS PROGRAMMING – FINAL PROJECT

WPF APPLICATION

Assignment Value: 30% of overall course mark.

Due Dates: Project Proposal/Plan - Friday, April 7th

Project Demonstration, Team Journal and Peer Evaluation – Monday, April 17th

Assignment Instructions:

As a team, propose, document and code a WPF application as described by the requirements of
this assignment (see below).

This is a group project, each group should have 3 to 4 members. You may choose your own group,
but the instructor has final say in group membership and may shuffle the teams if required. If the
group cannot decide on an application, the instructor will assign one. You want to avoid this. >=)
As this assignment is built around team collaboration, it is recommended that you use as many
team collaboration tools as you can. I.e. host the project in github (private accounts available if not
already provided) or Visual Studio Team Services, shared documents and demonstrate collaboration
through assigning work items or tickets and show different branches for work.

Submission Instructions:

Proposal: One submission for the group, uploaded to the “Proposal” group dropbox.

Team Journal: Each student will keep a log of their own work. For the final Team Journal submission, all members’
logs should be combined in a single file, along with the other group journal requirements, then uploaded as a
single submission to the “Journal” group dropbox. Note: Logs will be marked as a group, not individually.

Project Solution (Application Code): Add all final project files & resources to a .ZIP folder and submit a single
submission for the group to the “Presentation” group dropbox.
Note: It is also recommended that each student push a copy of the final project to their own Git
repositories, to retain a copy for their own code portfolio.

Peer & Self Evaluations: Each group member will download the provided member evaluation rubrics (.XLS file)
complete evaluations for themselves and all other team members, then upload the completed evaluations file to
the “Peer Evaluations” group dropbox.
Note: Team members who do not upload a peer/self evaluation file will receive a zero (0) for themselves
and all other team members will receive full marks from the non-participating student.

Evaluation:
To ensure the greatest chance of success on this assignment, be sure to check the marking rubrics
at the end of this document or in Brightspace. The rubrics contain the criteria your instructor will be
assessing when marking your assignment.
